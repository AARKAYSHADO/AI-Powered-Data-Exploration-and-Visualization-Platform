2. Natural Language Processing: User queries are transformed into precise SQL queries using advanced language models.
3. Data Querying: The generated SQL queries are executed against the database to retrieve relevant data.
4. Data Visualization: The retrieved data is analyzed, and suitable visualization techniques are recommended. Python code is generated to create and display the visualizations.
